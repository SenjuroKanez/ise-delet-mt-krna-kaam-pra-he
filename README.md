## 🧠 About This Repo
This repo is my **3rd semester ka dard aur code** —  
A mix of *sleep deprivation*, *instant noodles*, and *endless debugging* 💀  

💡 Here you’ll find:
- C++ code for DSA — arrays, stacks, queues, and existential crises.  
- Python scripts for AI — where “AI” stands for **Actually Importing** libraries.  
- Random experiments that *may or may not run properly*.  
- And maybe... a few hidden gems of “print(‘Hello, GPA!’)”

## 🧰 Tech Stack
| Language | Mood | Usage |
|-----------|------|--------|
| 🐍 Python | Chill | For AI, ML, DL aur assignments copy karne ke liye |
| 💻 C++    | Serious | For DSA, logic, and segfault adventures |

## 🤝 How to Use
1. Clone the repo like a pro:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lulguy/ise-delet-mt-krna-kaam-pra-he

Open folder according to your mental stability:

🐍 python/ → if you trust imports more than logic

💻 cpp/ → if you like pain, recursion, and seg faults

Run. Cry. Debug. Repeat.

🎯 Goal

Survive the semester ✅

Pass the labs ✅

Understand recursion ❌

GPA > 3.0 (Inshallah 🤲)
